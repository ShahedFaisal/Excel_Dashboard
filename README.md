# Excel Dashboards

The goal of this project is to showcase management dashboards prepared using built-in advanced Excel functions, charting techniques and tools (i.e. Power Query).

## Sales Dashboard

This interactive dashboard shows sales trends and KPIs for a B2B company including sales revenue and growth, new vs. returning customers, forecast vs. actual sales, target achievement, top customers' contribution to revenue, and the performance of Key Account Managers (KAM).

The data was aggregated and cleaned using Power Query. Then it was analyzed using Excel functions such as IFS, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, INDEX, MATCH, OFFSET, EDATE, AGGREGATE etc. and visualized with dynamic charting techniques.
